## My_Convex_Optimization
One of the main challenges of Data Science and more specifically in Machine Learning is the performance measure. </br>
How to measure performance efficiently so that our model predictions meet the business objectives? </br>
This project is meant to be an introduction to some convex optimization tools and to implement your own optimization algorithm.</br>
* Gradient Descent Methods
* Simplex algorithm

## My_Linear_Regression
Getting and analysing existing data is the very first task of a data scientist. The next step is to find tendencies and to generalize. Another way of generalizing is by creating a model from the existing examples and make prediction based on that model.So 
feature_2 = θ0 + θ1 . feature_1. We then need to define a performance measure (how well the model performs) or a cost function (how bad the model performs).
These kind of problems and models are called Linear Regression.
The goal of this journey is to explore linear and logistic regressions.

## My_First_Scrapper
Using python libraries requests and beautifulsoup4, return a CSV of the TOP 25 trending repository from Github
* Request (with request)
* Extract (with beautifulsoup4)
* Transform
* Format

## My_Tu_Verras
We are going to work on a Boston housing prices dataset. </br> 
Basically what a data scientist would want to do with such a dataset is to build a model to predict the value.</br> 
In this case, the MEDV,based on the different other attributes like the number of rooms, the distance to schools etc. Here, we are not going to make any predictions from models, but we are going to try and understand what the data has to tell us.

## My_Ds_Babel
Data is heart of an information system. </br>
Converting them from a format to another or migrating them to another database is a very important skills.</br>
Your mission will be to help translate from one format to another. </br>
We will be working with 2 very popular format: SQL and CSV.</br>

## My_Select_Query
Create a class MySelectQuery.
Your constructor will receive a CSV content (as a string), first line will be the name of the column. It will be prototyped: **constructor(csv_content)**. Implement a where method which will take 2 arguments: column_name and value. It will return an array of strings which matches the value. It will be prototyped: **where(column_name, criteria)**

## My_Open_The_Iris
First end-to-end project in data science. which means:
* Loading the dataset.
* Summarizing the dataset.
* Visualizing the dataset.
* Evaluating some algorithms.
* Making some predictions.
A must seen example about data science is the iris dataset. We will predict which class of iris plant does a plant belongs to based on its characteristics.

## My_Mr_Clean
The search engine should be simple at first. The user needs to be able to type some words and the engine returns the most relevant articles. We are going to build a simple model for some article from Wikipedia.
* Get some article from Wikipedia to work with.
* Extract meaningful and usable content from this article.
* Clean up and filter the data to narrow the scope to relevant words
* Build a simple frequency model.
* Analysing the article based on this model.

## My_M_and_A
Your first mission was to build a strong, robust and scalable customers database for the exponential growth the company will soon have. </br>
Your mission will be to integrate their 3 customers table into ours.</br>
Store everything in the sqlite3 table customers you've designed. </br>
Your function will be called my_m_and_a and will receive the content of the 3 CSV and the name of the sqlite3 database you will have to use.
